  ABOUT SIIGNA
  Siigna is an online open-source 2-dimensional CAD application that
  runs online on the JAVA virtual machine. It is intended to suit the
  needs of different groups. Therefore the backbone of Siigna, the
  mainline, is relatively small and a majority of functionality is
  branched out into modules. The idea is that Siigna can be loaded
  with different sets of modules, creating different modes for
  generating different types of artwork.

  SIIGNA MODULES
  This is the default Siigna modules. Modules contain a default set of
  drawing tools that allow users to create and manipulate artwork in
  the Siigna application. It is possible replace or add to the default
  modules to facilitate different drawing functionality, or even to
  create a whole new set of tools for manipulating text, linework and
  polygons. So in principle, Siigna could be expanded to become a platform
  for digital text editing, typesetting and layout, scripting based graphics,
  electronic circuit board creation - anything which can be represented
  as text and/or linework.

  SIIGNA MAINLINE
  The application itself is coded in the MAINLINE, which run independent
  of the modules. The Mainline uses a system for sending commands via
  messages, allowing entire drawings or parts of drawings to be sent
  dynamically and viewed on other instances of Siigna in real time.
